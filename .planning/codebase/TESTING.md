# Testing Status

## Current State
- **Automated Tests:** None found in the codebase.
- **Frameworks:** No testing libraries (Jest, Vitest, Cypress) are currently configured in `package.json`.

## Recommendations
- **Unit Testing:** Implement Vitest or Jest for logic in `src/lib/`.
- **Component Testing:** Use React Testing Library for UI components.
- **Integration Testing:** Test the Google Drive integration with mocked API responses.
